# Smoking-detection-system-in-public-place
With the continuous improvement of public attention to health issues and the increasing strengthening of government regulations on public environmental governance, the policy of comprehensive smoking ban in public places has been widely implemented. However, in the actual implementation process, due to its limitations, the traditional video surveillance technology shows inaccuracy and inefficiency in identifying and capturing hidden, complex and changeable smoking behaviors in real time, including but not limited to the difficulty in distinguishing smoking actions from similar behaviors, the great influence of ambient light and perspective changes, and the bottleneck of manual analysis in processing massive surveillance data. In order to meet this challenge and achieve efficient intelligent supervision, intelligent video analysis technology based on in-depth learning came into being, and gradually became the core solution to solve the problem of smoking behavior monitoring in public places. This kind of technology makes full use of the powerful image recognition and understanding ability of deep neural network, and can provide high-precision support for target detection and behavior pattern analysis in various complex scenes by training large-scale annotation data sets. Specifically, advanced deep learning models such as deeplabV3 + and YOLO are applied to quickly locate smokers and their behavioral characteristics in video pictures, which can accurately capture the occurrence of smoking behavior even in crowded or dynamically changing environments. In addition, by combining behavioral sequence analysis and spatiotemporal context information, the system can further enhance the understanding and judgment of continuous action patterns, ensuring that even short and subtle smoking actions are not missed. To sum up, the development and application of intelligent video surveillance system based on deep learning technology not only effectively fills in the shortcomings of traditional monitoring methods, but also effectively promotes the implementation of smoking ban regulations in public places, providing strong technical support for building a healthy and smoke-free social environment.

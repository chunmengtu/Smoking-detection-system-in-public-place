# Smoking-detection-system-in-public-place
With the growing public concern for health and the increased government regulations on public environmental management, comprehensive smoking bans in public places have become widely enforced. However, traditional video surveillance technology has proven to be inaccurate and inefficient in identifying and capturing hidden and complex smoking behaviors in real time. This includes challenges such as distinguishing smoking from similar behaviors, the impact of ambient light, perspective changes, and the bottleneck of manual analysis in processing massive surveillance data.

To address these limitations, intelligent video analysis technology based on in-depth learning has emerged as a core solution for monitoring smoking behavior in public places. This technology harnesses the powerful image recognition and understanding abilities of deep neural networks, providing high-precision support for target detection and behavior pattern analysis in complex scenes through large-scale annotation data sets. Advanced deep learning models like deeplabV3+ and YOLO are applied to swiftly locate smokers and their behavioral characteristics in video footage, accurately capturing smoking behavior even in crowded or dynamically changing environments.

Furthermore, by incorporating behavioral sequence analysis and spatiotemporal context information, the system can enhance its understanding and judgment of continuous action patterns, ensuring that even subtle smoking actions are not overlooked. In conclusion, the development and application of intelligent video surveillance systems based on deep learning technology not only address the limitations of traditional monitoring methods but also effectively facilitate the implementation of smoking ban regulations in public spaces, providing essential technical support for creating a healthy and smoke-free social environment.
